Client Repository Template

Repository Purpose

This repository is a client-facing project repository that operates under Prospera OS Governance.

It is intended for engineering implementation, documentation, and AI-assisted execution within predefined governance boundaries.

This repository does not define governance rules, authority models, or enforcement logic.

Governance Model

This repository adopts Prospera OS Governance as its governing framework.

Governance authority, rules, enforcement mechanisms, and escalation paths are defined externally.

See GOVERNANCE_ADOPTION_DECLARATION.md for the formal adoption declaration.

What This Repository Is For

This repository may be used for:

Software implementation and configuration

Architecture realization based on approved specifications

Documentation of implementation artifacts

AI-assisted code generation under permitted participation modes

Testing, validation, and delivery activities

All activities must comply with the adopted governance specifications.

What This Repository Is NOT For

This repository must NOT be used for:

Defining or modifying governance rules

Redefining authority ownership or escalation paths

Overriding AI participation boundaries

Introducing enforcement logic or governance tooling

Treating AI-generated outputs as authoritative decisions

Any attempt to perform the above is considered a governance violation.

AI Usage Rules

AI systems may be used only as permitted by the adopted governance specifications.

AI outputs are advisory unless explicitly reviewed and approved by a responsible human.

AI systems may not make final decisions, enforce rules, or override human authority.

All AI-assisted activities must remain traceable and reviewable.

Authority and Responsibility

AI systems do not hold authority.

Responsibility cannot be delegated to tools, models, or automation.

All work must be traceable to responsible human actors.

Non-compliant artifacts may be invalidated.

In case of uncertainty, ambiguity, or conflict, governance escalation must occur.
