Prospera OS
Client Governance Violation Sample Repository
Authority Boundary

Authority Boundary Statement:
This repository provides illustrative samples of governance violations for educational and analytical purposes only. It does not define governance authority, enforcement mechanisms, or execution constraints. All canonical governance and execution definitions reside exclusively in the prospera-os repository.

Repository Purpose

This repository exists to document illustrative examples of governance violations in client project contexts operating under Prospera OS Governance.

Its purpose is to help organizations, auditors, and engineers understand:

What constitutes a governance violation

How violations may arise in practice

Why certain actions are prohibited under Prospera OS Governance

This repository is informational only and does not perform enforcement, validation, or automated judgment.

Scope of Violation Examples

Examples documented in this repository may include (but are not limited to):

Treating AI-generated outputs as authoritative decisions

Allowing AI systems to bypass defined approval or review steps

Redefining governance rules within a client repository

Obscuring or removing human responsibility attribution

Introducing execution or enforcement logic without governance approval

These examples are presented for analysis and learning, not as exhaustive or prescriptive lists.

What This Repository Is NOT

This repository must NOT be used for:

Enforcing governance rules

Validating or certifying compliance

Acting as an audit authority

Replacing human judgment with automated violation detection

Making final determinations of responsibility or fault

All determinations of violation status remain the responsibility of designated human authorities under Prospera OS Governance.

Relationship to Validation and Client Repositories

This repository is complementary to:

Client Repository Template

Client Validation Repository

It may be referenced during:

Governance reviews

Training and onboarding

Post-incident analysis

However, it does not trigger enforcement actions or escalation by itself.

Governance and Accountability

All violation examples must:

Clearly describe the context and action

Identify which governance principles were violated

Preserve traceability to responsible human roles

This repository does not assign blame or penalties.
