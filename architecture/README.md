Architecture Directory

This directory contains architectural decisions, system structure definitions, and high-level design artifacts.

This directory is human-authoritative.

AI systems may assist with analysis, modeling, or documentation support.

All architectural decisions must be made, reviewed, and approved by humans.

This directory does not contain implementation code.

Artifacts in this directory define intent and structure,
not execution behavior.
