Category: Repository Entry

Purpose

This document is the canonical entry point for this client repository.

It explains how this repository is intended to be used under Prospera OS Governance and how engineers, architects, and AI systems are expected to interact with it across engineering phases.

This file does not define governance rules.
It provides operational orientation only.

What This Repository Is

This repository is a client-facing engineering project operating under Prospera OS Governance.

It is intended for implementation, documentation, and AI-assisted execution within predefined governance boundaries.

All engineering work performed here must comply with external governance specifications adopted by this repository.

What This Repository Is NOT

This repository does not define governance rules, authority models, enforcement logic, or escalation procedures.

It is not a place to reinterpret, override, or modify Prospera OS Governance.

Governance definitions live outside this repository and are referenced, not duplicated.

How Governance Applies Here

This repository adopts Prospera OS Governance through an explicit adoption declaration.

Governance authority, AI participation constraints, enforcement rules, and escalation paths are defined externally.

This repository is governed, not governing.

See GOVERNANCE_ADOPTION_DECLARATION.md for the formal adoption statement.

Where to Start by Engineering Phase

Engineering work should begin based on the active phase.

Phase 1: Problem Definition and System Framing
Start in specs/
Define requirements, intent, and constraints.

Phase 2: Architecture and Design Specification
Start in architecture/
Define system structure, interfaces, and design decisions.

Phase 3: Implementation and Construction
Start in implementation/
Write executable code and configuration under approved specifications and architecture.

Phase 4 and Phase 5 activities occur through review, validation, deployment, and evolution processes governed externally.

Rules of Engagement with AI

AI systems may assist with analysis, drafting, modeling, and code generation only within approved specifications and architecture.

AI systems may not introduce new requirements, redefine architecture, or bypass human review.

All AI-generated artifacts require human review and approval before merge, release, or deployment.

Human authority is mandatory and non-delegable.

When to Escalate

Escalation is required when:

Governance boundaries are unclear or conflicted.

AI participation exceeds permitted scope.

Authority ownership cannot be clearly identified.

Human review requirements cannot be satisfied.

Escalation must follow Prospera OS Governance escalation rules defined externally.

Pointer to Governance Source of Truth

The authoritative governance source for this repository is maintained outside this project.

All governance interpretation, enforcement, and audit resolution must reference the Prospera OS Governance repositories adopted by this project.

This repository must never act as a governance authority.
