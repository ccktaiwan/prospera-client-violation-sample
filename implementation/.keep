Implementation Directory

This directory contains executable code, configuration, and operational artifacts.

This directory permits AI-assisted execution under defined governance constraints.

AI systems may generate code, configuration, or documentation drafts
only when operating within approved specifications and architecture.

All AI-generated artifacts must be reviewed and approved by humans
before merge, release, or deployment.

AI systems may not introduce new requirements, redefine architecture,
or bypass human review at any stage.

Artifacts in this directory are subject to enforcement and escalation rules
defined by Prospera OS Governance.

Execution without human approval is prohibited.
