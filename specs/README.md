Specifications Directory

This directory contains formal specifications, requirements, and design constraints
used to guide implementation and validation.

This directory is human-authoritative.

AI systems may assist with drafting, analysis, or consistency checks,
but may not finalize, approve, or redefine specifications.

All specifications must be reviewed and approved by responsible humans
before they are considered binding.

Artifacts in this directory define expected behavior and constraints,
not execution logic.

Specifications may be referenced by implementation and validation artifacts,
but do not execute directly.
